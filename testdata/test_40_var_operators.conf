# The CRS checks the tx.crs_setup_version variable to ensure that the setup
# file is included at the correct time. This detects situations where
# necessary settings are not defined, for instance if the file
# inclusion order is incorrect, or if the user has forgotten to
# include the crs-setup.conf file.
#
# If you are upgrading from an earlier version of the CRS and you are
# getting this error, please make a new copy of the setup template
# crs-setup.conf.example to crs-setup.conf, and re-apply your policy
# changes. There have been many changes in settings syntax from CRS2
# to CRS3, so an old setup file may cause unwanted behavior.
#
# If you are not planning to use the crs-setup.conf template, you must
# manually set the tx.crs_setup_version variable before including
# the CRS rules/* files.
#
# The variable is a numerical representation of the CRS version number.
# E.g., v3.0.0 is represented as 300.
